# Spring Data R2DBC Examples

The example evaluates Spring Data R2DBC as an alternative to Spring Data JPA and Spring Data JDBC.

Spring Data R2DBC uses Reactive Relational Database Connectivity, a reactive programming APIs to relational databases.
In contrast to the blocking nature of JDBC, R2DBC is non-blocking and has a reactive API.
Spring Data R2DBC used together with Spring WebFlux allows to develop fully-reactive and non-blocking applications.

## Prerequisites

* JDK 11
* Docker at least 1.6.0

## How to run tests

To build project and run all tests use command

```bash
./gradlew cleanTest test -i
```

## Implementation details

* JDK 11
* Spring Boot 2.2.x
* Spring Data Release Train Neumann-RC1
* Spring Data R2DBC 1.1.0.RC1
* [MapStruct](https://mapstruct.org/) 1.3.1.Final
* JUnit 5
* [Testcontainers](https://www.testcontainers.org/)

This example has a simple domain model. 
A book has at least one author and belongs to at least one category.
A book can be rated. An average rating and a total number of ratings are tracked. 

Spring Data R2DBC concept is to be a simple and easy to use object mapper and 
does **NOT** provide many features of ORM.

One-to-one, one-to-many and many-to-many relationships are not supported.

Thus, in contrast to JPA, relationships must be modeled by referencing the ID 
and join tables for many-to-many relationships must be mapped to a Java class.

## Test cases

* Queries - `com.example.spring.data.r2dbc.BookRepositoryTest`
  * `CrudRepository.findById`
  * Query method with `Sort`
  * `@Query` with SQL and pagination
  * Mapping from entity to DTO using MapStruct
